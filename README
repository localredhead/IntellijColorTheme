# Here is my intellij color theme.  I have been tuning this for about 2 years.

* I wanted to provide a better textmate-like color scheme that was pleasing to the eye 
* This should not strain the eyes after extended periods.  The key hear is to have the syntax stand out but stick out.  No neon colors.
* To use the color scheme, go to File > Import Settings > Find the .jar > Choose Color Scheme and click next.  Enjoy.
* Here are some vm args to make things run smoother 
  * -XX:MaxPermSize=150m -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:+CMSIncrementalMode -XX:+CMSIncrementalPacing -XX:+AggressiveOpt -XX:+UseBiasedLocking -XX:+CMSPermGenSweepingEnabled -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -XX:+DoEscapeAnalysis
